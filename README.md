nppPhotos
=========

A simple script for adding a logo and text to a photograph

Requirements are to:

* Monitor a folder
* For each photo added
	* Add the logo(s) to the photo with optional text, resizing 
	* Save the updated image into a 'completed' folder as a jpeg
	* Move teh orginal image into a 'original' folder

Simple in idea. 

Looking at two options, either perl or python.
